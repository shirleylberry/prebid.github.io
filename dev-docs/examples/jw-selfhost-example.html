player_notes:
- You must have the correct JW Player license that allows you to play advertising.
- The different methods of embedding JW Player on your site can be found <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed">here</a>. 
- For this example we will be using method 3, a self-hosted player and JW Platform hosted content. To see an example using the cloud-hosted player, click <a href="#">here</a>.
- No matter what embedding method you choose to use, you must follow the <b>custom embed</b> instructions. You cannot use the single-line embed.

#### Line 12 to 15: Pre-define invokeVideoPlayer
invokeVideoPlayer is called when all the bids are returned from prebid. Defining invokeVideoPlayer at the start of the page ensures that this function will always be defined, and we will always be storing the url of the vast tag, regardless of the timing of the rest of the page.

#### Line 74: Call invokeVideoPlayer
Once all the bids are back, call invokeVideoPlayer and pass in the url. This will either store the url in the variable tempTag, or pass it to the video player.

#### Line 110: Include the player library
The script tag for your cloud-hosted video player can be found in your JW Platform account on the player's page, under 'Cloud Player Library URL'. The player will use the settings you define in JW Platform unless you override them on the page in the setup call.

#### Line 121: Get a reference to the player instance
Get a reference to the player by calling `jwplayer()` and passing in the id of the div you want to render the player in. This does not mean that the player will show up on the page, just that we can now use the player api on it.
</div>

<div markdown="1">
#### Line 124 to 129: Call setup on the player and enable advertising
Call `setup()` on the player instance and pass in the settings as a json object. The settings must include an advertising block with the client we want to use in order to play an ad.

#### Line 131 to 133: Play a prebid ad as a preroll
Before the player begins to play the content video, play an ad.
